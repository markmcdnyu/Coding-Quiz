# Coding Quiz
As I proceed in my career as a web developer, I will be asked to complete some kind of coding assessment, which is typically a combination of multiple-choice questions and interactive challenges. I built a timed code quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It also features a clean and polished user interface and is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.
